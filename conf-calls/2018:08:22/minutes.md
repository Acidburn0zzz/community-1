# Meeting minutes

This community call was a great one. We had demos from a community user Sun Fei and Qian from Harbor team. More than 30 people attended and some community members asked questions.
 
Thanks Sun Fei and Qian for the great work!
Thanks all the attendees for joining this community call. See you next time!
