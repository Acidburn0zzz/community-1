# Community

A place for Harbor community related material.

## Community Meetings

The Harbor Project holds bi-weekly community calls. To join or watch previous meeting notes and recordings, please see [meeting schedule](MEETING_SCHEDULE.md).

## Structure

* **presentations**: keeps the related slides about Harbor
* **conf-calls**: keeps the meeting materials and minutes sorted by meeting date
* **proposals**: keeps the proposals from community
  * new: normal proposal pool, contains the proposals which are neither `completed` nor `failed`. Use the [Proposal Template](./proposals/TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point.
  * completed: put the proposals whose implementations are already delivered in a release into this pool.
  * failed: archive the proposals which are never successfully implemented after a while into this pool.
