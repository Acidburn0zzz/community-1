# Replication work group

The mission of replication group is aggregating the efforts from all the interested parties to deliver a new replication service (next generation replication) to support the kinds of content replication requirements from the Harbor community.

The short-term goal of this workgroup is implementing the features described in the [design proposal](https://github.com/goharbor/community/pull/40), including:

* Replicate both image and chart
* Replicate content from Harbor to other non Harbor registries
* Replicate content from other registries to Harbor
* Easily extended to onboard the replication between Harbor and a new non Harbor registry
